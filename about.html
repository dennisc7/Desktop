 <p class="background-body">Raised in the southeastern side of Michigan, sisters Christina and Annie Dennis have grown up around the importance of a delicious and beautiful meal. The High Priestess stems from their eldest sister, Carlie Quezada, and her love for the mystical, the magical, and the stars. In tarot card readings, the High Priestess represents dreams, intuition, and duality, amongst other things. She sits between the pillars of Dark and Light at the gate directly before the great Mystery. The thin veil of awareness hung behind her, which piques the interest of onlookers, but keeps those outside from knowing too much. With this card in mind, The High Priestess Restaurant was conceived on the idea of following your dreams and being mindful of your intuition; the unknown of culinary magic is explored every day, and each onlooker of the veil of awareness are welcomed in to the great Mystery of magical and unique dishes.</p>
